A sorting algorithm AA is said to have more time complexity than a sorting algorithm BB if it uses more number of comparisons for sorting the same array than algorithm BB.

Given that algorithm AA uses XX comparisons to sort an array and algorithm BB uses YY comparisons to sort the same array, find whether algorithm AA has more time complexity.
